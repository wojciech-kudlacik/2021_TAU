## Selenium Assignment
### About
This directory contains python 3.7 + selenium project that tests two websites: [steam](https://store.steampowered.com/) and [eobuwie](https://www.eobuwie.com.pl/).
### Features
- Multiple scenarios for both websites
- Info Logging to timestamped files
- Easy switching between browsers
****
### How to run
I assume that you have python 3.3+ installed
#### Selenium
In order to run this project you need to have [selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html) installed
```bash
pip install selenium 
```
You may want to consider using venv.

Alretnatively you may utilize the requirement.txt file present in the repo and do:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
#### Config
In order to utilize tests present in the project you need to create **config.json** file in this directory:
```bash
2021_TAU/selenium_assignments/config.json
```
Config Template is available in the repository and looks like this:
```json
{
    "username": "",
    "password": "",
    "email": "",
    "driver": ""
}
```
**username**: steam username required to login
**password**: password for the test account used in testing
**email**: test e-mail used as a login for the e-obuwie website
**driver**: supply either: "chrome", "firefox" or "opera" - if you'd like to test a different browser, this is the place where you change it
#### Running tests
In order to run tests you need to **cd** into the directory that contains tests:
*/test_bundle
*/test_steam
*/test_eobuwie
```bash
cd path/to/project/2021_TAU/selenium_assignments/test_steam/
```
and then run it using python 3:
```bash
python3 name_of_test_file.py
```
****
### Folder Structure
#### drivers_package
This directory contais a simple script that choose a driver based on the **config["driver"]** value.
#### helper_methods
This directory contains simple scripts that help with waiting for certain elements of websites to be loaded.
#### logging_package
This directory contains logging functionality.
In order to log files you need to import this two methods into the test file:
```python
from logging_package.logger import create_logfile
from logging_package.logger import create_log
```
At the beggining of your test call the method to create a logfile in the logs directory:
```python
create_logfile()
```
The create_log method takes two arguments:
- log_level [integer] - values taken from the standard python logging package and can be: 20, 30, 40 or 50, by default the logging is set to INFO (20) 
- log_message ["string"] - message that you want to log
Example:
```python
create_log(20, "your log message")
```
#### logs
This directory contains logs after your tests ran - logs themselves are not stored in repo.
#### test_bundles
This directory contains bundles of tests - multiple tests running after eachother. Currently there is only one bundle: test_bundle_login.py that tests login process for both websites.
#### test_eobuwie
This directory contains [eobuwie](https://www.eobuwie.com.pl/).
#### test_steam
This directory contains tests for [steam](https://store.steampowered.com/).
